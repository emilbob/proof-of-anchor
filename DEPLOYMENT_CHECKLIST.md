## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Netlify Dashboard

- [ ] Set up deploy notifications (Email/Slack)
- [ ] Review build logs for warnings
- [ ] Check bandwidth usage
- [ ] Monitor build minutes

### Performance

- [ ] Enable Asset Optimization (Site Settings â†’ Build & deploy â†’ Post processing)
- [ ] Check Lighthouse scores
- [ ] Monitor loading times
- [ ] Optimize images if needed

### Security

- [ ] Review security headers (configured in netlify.toml)
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are not exposed in client code
- [ ] Set up branch protection in Git
- [ ] Review Netlify access permissions

## Continuous Deployment

Once set up, Netlify will automatically:

- âœ… Deploy when you push to main branch
- âœ… Create preview deployments for pull requests
- âœ… Run builds and show logs
- âœ… Rollback to previous deploys if needed

### Making Updates

```bash
# Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push origin main

# Netlify automatically deploys!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify `package.json` scripts are correct
3. Test build locally: `cd frontend && npm run build`
4. Check Node.js version compatibility

### Site Shows Blank Page

1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify environment variables in Netlify
4. Check that all assets are loading (Network tab)

### Wallet Connection Fails

1. Verify `VITE_PROGRAM_ID` is correct
2. Check `VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL` is accessible
3. Ensure wallet extension is installed
4. Check browser console for errors

### 404 Errors on Refresh

- This should be handled by `netlify.toml` redirects
- Verify `netlify.toml` is in the frontend directory
- Check redirect rules in Netlify dashboard
