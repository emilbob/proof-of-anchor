# Pages

This directory is reserved for future page components in the Proof Anchor zkTLS transparency rating system.

## Current Implementation

Currently, all functionality is implemented in a single-page application in `App.tsx` which includes:

- zkTLS proof generation and verification
- Project transparency analysis
- Community voting system
- Real-time status updates

## Future Pages

This directory can be used to organize the application into multiple pages when needed:

- `HomePage.tsx` - Main landing page with project overview
- `TransparencyPage.tsx` - Detailed transparency analysis page
- `VotingPage.tsx` - Community voting interface
- `HistoryPage.tsx` - Proof history and verification records
